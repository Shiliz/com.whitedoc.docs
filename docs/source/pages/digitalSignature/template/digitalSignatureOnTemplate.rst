2. Fill the required field "Role" with role details (f.e.: name of the role);
3. Confirm addition.

As soon as you did the steps above you can add document and add the field "EDS to the document"

Which actions we can do with signature roles?
============================================

Signer flow is definetly similar to the Assignee flow. You can make similar actions with Signer flow as with Asignee flow except set a role as a copy.
So, you can do the following:

1. Add or remove role from the flow;
2. Add default mailbox as a role;
3. Set the order of the signers. You can set order or left it as default and all signers receive the document at the same time.

You can add as many signers as you need but we support only 30 recipients in the flow, including the assignee roles.

Digital signature addition to the document
==========================================

To use the digital signature on the document you have to add signer role. You may add only one digital signature for one role on the one document.

You can add the field in any place of the document. To do this:

1. Drag and drop the field to the document;
2. Set unique field name;
3. Select the role of the signer who has to set a signature;

On the template you will watch the element which looks like the button with title: DS - "role name".

Digital signature removing from the document
==========================================

You can remove digital signature from the document in three ways:

1. Using "Delete" or  "Backspace" button on your keyboard, just focus on the place of the "Signature" button in the document and press the button on your keyboard;
2. Using field menu. Click on the button and in the right bottom corner, click on the "Delete" button;
3. You may delete the role and if it is last role in the flow the signature field deletes automatically with role.

If you delete the role with assigned digital signature field(s) you have to re-assign the field to another role if such is presented. If not role will be 
deleted with fields.
